## IEEE SSCS Open-Source Ecosystem “Code-a-Chip” Travel Grant Awards at ISSCC'23



**The International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) 2023 Code-a-Chip Travel Grant Award** is created to:
 1. Promote *reproducible* chip design using *open-source* tools and *notebook-driven* design flows and 
 2. Enable up-and-coming *talents* as well as seasoned *open-source enthusiasts* to travel to the Conference and interact with the leading-edge chip design community. 

This program is made possible by a donation from the [CHIPS Alliance](https://chipsalliance.org/), a non-profit organization hosted by The [Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org/).  
## Program Rules
- The program is **open** to anyone (no restrictions). 
- Teaming is encouraged, but each team must identify a leader who can travel to the ISSCC to receive the award. 
- IEEE SSCS membership is encouraged, but not required.
- Applicants must submit an **open-source Jupyter notebook** detailing an innovative circuit design using **open-source tools 
    - examples: [inverter](https://developers.google.com/silicon/guides/digital-inverter-openlane), [temperature sensor](https://github.com/idea-fasoc/OpenFASOC/blob/main/docs/source/OpenFASoC_temp_sense_gen.ipynb)
- Each submission must contain a suitable **open-source license** (e.g., Apache 2.0).
- A jury will evaluate the submissions and award up to 12 designs within two main categories:
    - *Category 1*: **Silicon-proven** designs. The technology used in the original design can be different from the one used in the notebook. The objective is to disseminate the main ideas and design choices using **open-source tools and PDKs** in a **reproducible** manner. The temperature sensor example falls into this category.
    - *Category 2*: A new idea that could be the basis for a future tapeout, with the same objectives regarding open **dissemination** and **reproducibility** as in Category 1.
## Program Logisitcs
- The notebooks must be submitted through a [GitHub Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) at the [SSCS Open-Source Ecosystem Code-a-Chip](https://github.com/sscs-ose/sscs-ose-code-a-chip.github.io) (OSE) GitHub portal (Please check for further details and instructions).
- Travel stipends of up to US$2,500 will be awarded (in form of a check to the winners).
- The winners are expected to attend the ISSCC’s Student-Research Preview session (Sunday evening) to be recognized for their awards, as well as an open source meetup event (details TBA).
- The travel awards will only be honored to awardees who have completed conference registration and attended the ISSCC 2023 conference. The awardees will need to show a valid ID (passport, driver’s license, etc.) at the conference registration desk. 
## Program Schedule
- November 15, 2022, 11:59 PM Pacific Time: Notebook submission deadline (GitHub pull request)
- December 1, 2022: Announcement of winners
- February 19-23: Attend ISSCC
## Useful Links
Since the individual open-source SW packages evolve quickly, documentation is often lacking behind. Luckily, the open-source developer community is accessible, and very often, you can reach them directly on Slack to help you out. You should get access to [skywater-pdk.slack.com](skywater-pdk.slack.com) as this is the watering hole where everyone meets. There is also a dedicated channel for the 2023 ISSCC'23 Code-a-Chip Notebook Competition (**#ieee-sscs-cac-23**).

And finally: Visit our [IEEE SSCS page](https://sscs.ieee.org) for all kinds of information related to solid-state circuits, like tutorials, conferences, publications, etc.
